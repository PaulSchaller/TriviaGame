# TriviaGame

### This program is a trivia game.  The user is given a test of trivia questions that is answered by the player.  
### The test is graded and results displayed.

## The trivia questions are on the topic of the movie *Star Wars*.  There are twelve questions on the test for the
## player to answer.  After the questions are answered, the player submits the test to be graded.  

## The user has two minutes and 30 seconds to answer the questions.  After the time limit, the test ends.  The 
## test is then graded.

I used javascript, jQuery, html, and css in the development of this game.
