# Trivia Game

### This program is a trivia game.  The player is given a test of trivia questions that is answered 
### by the player.  The test is graded and results displayed.

### The trivia questions are on the topic of *Star Wars*.  
### There are twelve questions on the test for the player to answer.  
### After the questions are answered, the player submits the test to be graded.  

### The user has two minutes and 30 seconds to answer the questions.  After the time limit, 
### the test ends.  The test is then graded.

I used javascript, jQuery, html, and css in the development of this game.
